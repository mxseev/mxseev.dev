Fullstack developer with a very wide specialization, 
from frontend to infrastructure, from backend to embedded. 
Went all the way from simple websites written in Windows-notepad 
when in 14-15 years old to full&#x2011;fledged web (and beyond) applications.

### Work experience

#### *2016-2020: studying, starting a career, freelancing*

I started developing back in my school years, and after a couple of years 
I began doing small freelance jobs (markup of simple websites, mostly). 

#### *2021-2023: middle fullstack at [gooditworks](https://goodit.works)*

One of the freelance orders was mini-project for gooditworks

almost all their projects (more info about them you can find on their site).
